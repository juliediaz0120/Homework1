<p>What constitutes a creative web project today?</p>

<p>What I would constitute a creative web project is an online work with the intent to be accessible to all people and with whatever goal the creators wish to pursue. Web projects can come in many mediums and intents including art, activism, games, and data visualization.</p>

<p>How do each of you wish to employ the web or the internet as a creative platform?</p>

I would love to use the internet as a way to make my own art and reach out to many people. I really love animation and using the internet can help my artistic creations reach out to more people. I really hope to tell the stories of people like me and help them feel less ostracised.


<p>What are your goals in this course?</p>

<p>My goals in this course are to be able to confidently say I can build a website and hopefully make one for my self to display my artistic creations. I hope to be able to make my own website so I don't have to rely on others and I can make myself a platform in which people can easily access my work.</p>
